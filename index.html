      <h1>To My Forever Love 💌</h1>
      <p>My dearest Anushka, my Shri Sakhi, my baby —</p>
      <p>I love you more than words can ever express. You are not just a part of my life; you are the very meaning of it. Every beat of my heart whispers your name, and every breath I take carries the warmth of your love.</p>
      <p>I promise to hold your hand through all storms, to laugh with you in joy, to be your comfort in sorrow, and to love you unconditionally — not just for today or tomorrow, but for the lifetime we are going to build together.</p>
      <p>You’ve given me something magical: a love that feels like home. I am proud to call you mine, and even prouder to say I’ll never stop loving you. You're my queen, my partner, my best friend — and loving you is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever done.</p>
      <p>Forever yours,<br><strong>Karnav 💖</strong></p>

      <h1>The Day We Met ❤️</h1>
      <p>Baby, I remember the day and the night we met... I was called to your house. The moment I stepped in, I saw the word "beauty" sitting on the sofa. I fell in love with you all over again and I couldn’t wait to hug you.</p>
      <p>I sat beside you and my entire body was shaking. My heart was pounding so fast. I couldn’t think of anything, so I let my arm go around you... and oh boy — the moment you had your head on me and took that deep breath while cuddling in gently — that moment was so warm and special to me.</p>
      <p>I remember every single detail and it makes me smile to this day. I don’t know how to say or express something openly, but I am so deeply in love with you.</p>
      <p>The moment I turned your head towards me and gave you a soft kiss — it was like the universe collided. The other voices stopped and there was calmness. The moment I laid my head on your chest — that very moment I felt like a literal baby, a baby who is safe in her mother's hands.</p>
      <p>I am dedicating this to you — and the amount of respect I have for you is insanely high, baby. You're my EVERYTHING.</p>

      <p>I love you, my baby... I love you forever. &lt;3</p>
